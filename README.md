# Plants List, React + Supabase + Vercel + Bootstrap

**The live version of this app is available at [https://plants-react-app-manijehshirzadeh.vercel.app/](https://plants-react-app-manijehshirzadeh.vercel.app/)**

This project is to address this code test [Plant tracker app](https://gist.github.com/tristan-go/00cadfa3f8c0f3a9665e62bb05842e81).
Also this is done as the final project of my `General Assembly JavaScript Web Development Course`.

The Requirements of the application:

## AC1: Homepage: listing of all pages

At the homepage, the app will show you the listing of all the added plants. Each plant item will have `Name`, `Species` and `Watering Instructions`.

## AC2: Add Plant Page: a form to add a new plant to the listing

This page has a form of three fields.

### Bootstrap

Used Bootstrap to make the app looking good.

### Supabase

The database for this app is created and hosted on Supabase.

### Vercel

Vercel is used to host and deploy the app.

# What's Next:

- Make the `Add New Plant` button disabled in the form page, till the user enter all the inputs.
- Add the ability to `add an image` for each plant. Currently cannot use the upload feature of the supabase. It's tricky
- Add the ability to `delete` a plant from the list.
- Add the ability to `edit` a plant.
